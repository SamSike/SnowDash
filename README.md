### Game Summary
Running Man is a runner game, the main goal of this game is to get to the highest stage possible
while not crashing into any obstacles. While running, the player can move up, down, left, or right, 
corresponding to the direction they want to move, to avoid crashing into oncoming obstacles, such as 
vehicles, walls, boxes, poles, etc. Crashing results in the game ending. The player can collect various items/power ups to 
enhance their character (eg. running slower, teleport forward, jump higher). Other items could be armour to block one collision. 
Player needs to reach the finish line to complete each stage/level, and unlock new stages as they go along.
